                My name is Cristian Vazquez <BR></BR>
            
                I have been employed with Santa Maria-Bonita School District since about 2019.
                I am currently a Microcomputer/Network Support Technician and I support Bonita Elementary, Ontiveros Elementary, Oakley Elementary, Arellanes Elementary, and Arellanes Jr. High. <BR></BR>
            
                I am a self-starter and I am great at learning things by myself. In middle school, I taught myself how to modify video game consoles to install custom features. In high school, I taught myself how to repair computers. I have taught myself how to work on cars; I do the majority of the mechanical work on my cars and that includes intermediate-advanced level tasks like replacing components and minor internal engine work. I am currently teaching myself more about the networking side of IT. Networking used to be one of my weaknesses, but it is quickly becoming not that. <BR></BR>
