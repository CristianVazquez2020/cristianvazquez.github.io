            I graduated from San Luis Obispo High School in 2014, earning a High School Diploma. <BR></BR>
            
            Immediately after high school, I attended Cuesta College where I explored different majors; I took a variety of classes in Mathematics, Political Science, Business Administration, and Philosophy, but I finally decided on Computer Science.<BR></BR>
            
            In 2018, I earned a Certificate of Specialization in Web Page Coding from Cuesta College. <BR></BR>
            
            I completed all the lower-division Computer Science classes at Cuesta College and transferred to California State University Monterey Bay, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a concentration in Software Engineering in the Fall of 2022. <BR></BR>
            
            I am currently attending Cuesta College to earn an Associates of Science in Management Information Systems and I am preparing to enter a graduate program to earn either a Master's in Business Administration, or a Master's in Computer Science.
